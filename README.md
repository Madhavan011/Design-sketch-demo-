Create Wireframe Sketches:

At least two views of your site:

Mobile view (e.g., smartphone layout)

Larger screen view (e.g., desktop or tablet layout)

Optional: If your site includes a unique landing page layout, sketch that separately.

Design Tips for Wireframes:

Use only black, white, and grey – avoid color, fonts, or fancy styles.

It’s okay to include actual content labels like “Logo”, “Navigation”, “Image”, or “Sign-up Form”.

Keep the sketches clear and organized.

Upload an Image:

Take a photo or scan of your sketches.

Make sure the image is clear and legible.

Write a Short Description (Write-up):
In your write-up, briefly explain:

What each view represents (e.g., mobile home page, desktop contact page).

Any unique features or layout choices.

If you added a landing page, describe its purpose and design.

If You Created a Video Instead:

Paste the URL to your video in the space provided on your submission form.

✍️ Sample Write-Up (You Can Edit and Use This):
Write-Up for Wireframe Assignment
I have created wireframe sketches for both mobile and desktop views of my website. The site is a personal portfolio that includes a landing page, an "About Me" section, a gallery, and a contact form.

The mobile view is a simplified vertical layout with a hamburger menu and single-column sections for readability.

The desktop view uses a horizontal navigation bar, a three-column layout for the gallery, and visible social media icons.

The landing page sketch shows a hero image with a welcome message and a call-to-action button.

All sketches focus on structure and content placement without using color or styling.
